This code was intended to solve divide and conquer problems issued by
CSE321 Algorithms, 2022

The problems were asking to implement:
  1. Problem 1, Ith Order Statistic Selection Algorithms:
    • Randomized Quick Selection
    • Deterministic Selection

  and use the previous methods to select the median of an array of integers.

  The assignment asked the students to analyze the 2 methods and compare them together
  with a naive sorting algorithm then extracting the median of the sorted array.

  2. Problem 2, The Closest Pair of Points:
    For an array of points, find the maximum side length of a square, having its point as a center, that can
    be drawn such that no square intersects with the other. The squares can only be vertical or horizontal aligned.
